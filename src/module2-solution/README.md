### Project Skeleton

No CSS/javascript frameworks are allowed for this assignment,
e.g. Bootstrap and jQuery are not included.  The project skeleton
is inspired by these frameworks, however.

Overview:

 # Created folders: css, fonts, js, to match Twitter Bootstrap template.
 # Created css and js override files, styles.css and script.js,
    inspired by the course examples.
 # README.md: A little metadata/notes.
 # index.html: The main page.
